# hello-world
First Github repository for Software Engineering
My name is Alex and I'm a 22-year-old senior at Eastern Michigan University. My major is Applied Computer Science and my minor is Computer Engineering Technology. I'm a fan of the fantasy and science fiction genres, end enjoy both reading and writing short stories. I like playing video games, drawing, and crocheting in my spare time.
